@article{Lucas2014,
abstract = {One of the ultimate goals in landslide hazard assessment is to predict maximum landslide extension and velocity. Despite much work, the physical processes governing energy dissipation during these natural granular flows remain uncertain. Field observations show that large landslides travel over unexpectedly long distances, suggesting low dissipation. Numerical simulations of landslides require a small friction coefficient to reproduce the extension of their deposits. Here, based on analytical and numerical solutions for granular flows constrained by remote-sensing observations, we develop a consistent method to estimate the effective friction coefficient of landslides. This method uses a constant basal friction coefficient that reproduces the first-order landslide properties. We show that friction decreases with increasing volume or, more fundamentally, with increasing sliding velocity. Inspired by frictional weakening mechanisms thought to operate during earthquakes, we propose an empirical velocity-weakening friction law under a unifying phenomenological framework applicable to small and large landslides observed on Earth and beyond.},

Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such "autoencoder" networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.},

abstract = {Subduction zones produce the largest earthquakes. Over the past two decades, space geodesy has revolutionized our view of crustal deformation between consecutive earthquakes. The short time span of modern measurements necessitates comparative studies of subduction zones that are at different stages of the deformation cycle. Piecing together geodetic 'snapshots' from different subduction zones leads to a unifying picture in which the deformation is controlled by both the short-term (years) and long-term (decades and centuries) viscous behaviour of the mantle. Traditional views based on elastic models, such as coseismic deformation being a mirror image of interseismic deformation, are being thoroughly revised.},

@article{MORLEY2001,
abstract = {The Tertiary rift basins of Thailand and adjacent countries show considerable variability in the timing of rift initiation, termination, the timing and magnitude of thermal subsidence, and the timing and intensity of inversion episodes. The rift basins developed on continental blocks that were extruded southeastwards. Hence their development must be tied into Himalayan extrusion tectonics. Current tectonic models propose that the Tertiary basins opened up as pull-apart basins associated with strike-slip faults. Published geochronology of strike-slip fault zone rocks, mapping of fault patterns in the Tertiary basins and mapped releasing-restraining bend geometries all indicate that in Thailand major sinistral strike-slip motion ceased at about 30 Ma, prior to the formation of most rift basins the Thailand. The effects of later dextral slip were minor and probably a result of reactivation during episodes of inversion during NW-SE to NE-SW (Himalayan) compression. Dextral slip was not responsible for opening most of the rift basins in Thailand. An alternative mechanism to open the rift basins is subduction rollback of the Indian plate to the west of Thailand. It is proposed that subuction rollback can help explain some of the characteristics of the rift basins such as non-uniform lithospheric extension, deep sag basins, and the diachronous onset and termination of rifting.},

@article{Ozolins2013,
abstract = {This article describes a general formalism for obtaining spatially localized ("sparse") solutions to a class of problems in mathematical physics, which can be recast as variational optimization problems, such as the important case of Schr\"{o}dinger's equation in quantum mechanics. Sparsity is achieved by adding an \$\$\{L\}\_\{1\}\$\$ regularization term to the variational principle, which is shown to yield solutions with compact support ("compressed modes"). Linear combinations of these modes approximate the eigenvalue spectrum and eigenfunctions in a systematically improvable manner, and the localization properties of compressed modes make them an attractive choice for use with efficient numerical algorithms that scale linearly with the problem size.},

@article{Feldl2006,
abstract = {It has been assumed that Himalayan earthquakes are driven by the release of compressional strain accumulating close to the Greater Himalaya. However, elastic models of the Indo-Asian collision using recently imaged subsurface interface geometries suggest that a substantial fraction of the southernmost 500 kilometres of the Tibetan plateau participates in driving great ruptures. We show here that this Tibetan reservoir of elastic strain energy is drained in proportion to Himalayan rupture length, and that the consequent growth of slip and magnitude with rupture area, when compared to data from recent earthquakes, can be used to infer a approximately 500-year renewal time for these events. The elastic models also illuminate two puzzling features of plate boundary seismicity: how great earthquakes can re-rupture regions that have already ruptured in recent smaller earthquakes and how mega-earthquakes with greater than 20 metres slip may occur at millennia-long intervals, driven by residual strain following many centuries of smaller earthquakes.},

@article{Ltaief2012,
abstract = {Fast multipole methods have O(N) complexity, are compute bound, and require very little synchronization, which makes them a favorable algorithm on next-generation supercomputers. Their most common application is to accelerate N-body problems, but they can also be used to solve boundary integral equations. When the particle distribution is irregular and the tree structure is adaptive, load-balancing becomes a non-trivial question. A common strategy for load-balancing FMMs is to use the work load from the previous step as weights to statically repartition the next step. The authors discuss in the paper another approach based on data-driven execution to efficiently tackle this challenging load-balancing problem. The core idea consists of breaking the most time-consuming stages of the FMMs into smaller tasks. The algorithm can then be represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where nodes represent tasks, and edges represent dependencies among them. The execution of the algorithm is performed by asynchronously scheduling the tasks using the QUARK runtime environment, in a way such that data dependencies are not violated for numerical correctness purposes. This asynchronous scheduling results in an out-of-order execution. The performance results of the data-driven FMM execution outperform the previous strategy and show linear speedup on a quad-socket quad-core Intel Xeon system.},

@article{Kozdon2012,
abstract = {We develop a stable and high-order accurate finite difference method for problems in earthquake rupture dynamics in complex geometries with multiple faults. The bulk material is an isotropic elastic solid cut by pre-existing fault interfaces that accommodate relative motion of the material on the two sides. The fields across the interfaces are related through friction laws which depend on the sliding velocity, tractions acting on the interface, and state variables which evolve according to ordinary differential equations involving local fields. The method is based on summation-by-parts finite difference operators with irregular geometries handled through coordinate transforms and multi-block meshes. Boundary conditions as well as block interface conditions (whether frictional or otherwise) are enforced weakly through the simultaneous approximation term method, resulting in a provably stable discretization. The theoretical accuracy and stability results are confirmed with the method of manufactured solutions. The practical benefits of the new methodology are illustrated in a simulation of a subduction zone megathrust earthquake, a challenging application problem involving complex free-surface topography, nonplanar faults, and varying material properties.},

@article{Sepulchre2006,
abstract = {The history of Eastern African hominids has been linked to a progressive increase of open grassland during the past 8 million years. This trend was explained by global climatic processes, which do not account for the massive uplift of eastern African topography that occurred during this period. Atmosphere and biosphere simulations quantify the role played by these tectonic events. The reduced topographic barrier before 8 million years ago permitted a zonal circulation with associated moisture transport and strong precipitation. Our results suggest that the uplift itself led to a drastic reorganization of atmospheric circulation, engendering the strong aridification and paleoenvironmental changes suggested by the data.},

@article{Boyd2006a,
abstract = {Finite element (FE) modelling based on data from three-dimensional high-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging systems provides a non-invasive method to assess structural mechanics. Automated mesh generation from these voxel based image data can be achieved by direct conversion to hexahedron elements, however these model representations have jagged edges. This paper proposes an automated method to generate smoothed FE meshes from voxel-based image data. Mesh fairing processes are utilized that allow constraints that control the smoothing process, and are computationally efficient. Surfaces of the mesh on the exterior, as well as interfaces between two tissues, can be smoothed by varying fairing parameters and constraint criteria. The method was tested on a variety of real and simulated three-dimensional data sets, resulting in both hexahedron and tetrahedron meshes. It was shown that the fairing process is linearly related to the number of smoothing iterations, and that peak stresses are reduced in FE simulations of the smoothed models. Although developed for micro-CT data sets, this fast and reliable mesh smoothing method could be applied to any three-dimensional image data where node and element connectivity have been defined.},

@article{Parsons2008,
abstract = {On 12 May 2008, the devastating magnitude 7.9 (Wenchuan) earthquake struck the eastern edge of the Tibetan plateau, collapsing buildings and killing thousands in major cities aligned along the western Sichuan basin in China. After such a large-magnitude earthquake, rearrangement of stresses in the crust commonly leads to subsequent damaging earthquakes. The mainshock of the 12 May earthquake ruptured with as much as 9 m of slip along the boundary between the Longmen Shan and Sichuan basin, and demonstrated the complex strike-slip and thrust motion that characterizes the region. The Sichuan basin and surroundings are also crossed by other active strike-slip and thrust faults. Here we present calculations of the coseismic stress changes that resulted from the 12 May event using models of those faults, and show that many indicate significant stress increases. Rapid mapping of such stress changes can help to locate fault sections with relatively higher odds of producing large aftershocks.},

abstract = {The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) offers an acceleration for pairwise interaction calculation, known as \$N\$-body problems, from \$\backslash mathcal\{O\}(N\^{}2)\$ to \$\backslash mathcal\{O\}(N)\$ with \$N\$ particles. This has brought dramatic increase in the capability of particle simulations in many application areas, such as electrostatics, particle formulations of fluid mechanics, and others. Although the literature on the subject provides theoretical error bounds for the FMM approximation, there are not many reports of the measured errors in a suite of computational experiments. We have performed such an experimental investigation, and summarized the results of about 1000 calculations using the FMM algorithm, to characterize the accuracy of the method in relation with the different parameters available to the user. In addition to the more standard diagnostic of the maximum error, we supply illustrations of the spatial distribution of the errors, which offers visual evidence of all the contributing factors to the overall approximation accuracy: multipole expansion, local expansion, hierarchical spatial decomposition (interaction lists, local domain, far domain). This presentation is a contribution to any researcher wishing to incorporate the FMM acceleration to their application code, as it aids in understanding where accuracy is gained or compromised.},

@article{Wyss1979,
abstract = {The evaluation of seismic risk at locations where sensitive man-made structures are planned depends critically on a correct estimate of the maximum expectable earthquake magnitude, Mmax, in that region. By assuming that the longest fault (or fault unit) with length Lmax could break in a single earthquake, one estimates Mmax from Lmax on the basis of a magnitude versus source-length relation, which is derived empirically. The maximum expectable ground accelerations are then estimated from Mmax. I propose that a more accurate estimate of Mmax can be obtained by determining the maximum expected rupture area, Amax, and using the magnitude-area relation M = log A + 4.15 (valid for M > 5.6). Amax can be obtained from the product of Lmax times the expected fault width. The latter can probably be estimated more accurately than Lmax on the basis of tectonic analysis and microearthquakes studies. The Mmax estimates derived from rupture area give more accurate results than the estimates based on rupture length alone, because narrow faults produce less powerful earthquakes than do wide faults of the same length.},

abstract = {We present parallel algorithms for constructing and traversing sparse octrees on graphics processing units (GPUs). The algorithms are based on parallel-scan and sort methods. To test the performance and feasibility, we implemented them in CUDA in the form of a gravitational tree-code which completely runs on the GPU.(The code is publicly available at: http://castle.strw.leidenuniv.nl/software.html) The tree construction and traverse algorithms are portable to many-core devices which have support for CUDA or OpenCL programming languages. The gravitational tree-code outperforms tuned CPU code during the tree-construction and shows a performance improvement of more than a factor 20 overall, resulting in a processing rate of more than 2.8 million particles per second.},

@article{Zorin1999,
abstract = {After the western edge of the Mongolian microcontinent joined the Siberian continent in the region of Central Mongolia in the earliest Permian, these two continental blocks remained turned at an angle of about 120° with respect to each other and separated (on greater extent of their present-day boundary) by an enormous gulf of the Paleopacific called the Mongolia–Okhotsk ocean. Closure of this ocean at the Early/Middle Jurassic boundary led to the complete collision of Siberia and Mongolia, which by then had already become part of the Mongolia–North China continent. This main collisional episode, which lasted through the Middle and Late Jurassic, involved thrusting, folding and magmatism and produced the Mongolia–Okhotsk belt. The Onon island-arc, which was located in the Mongolia–Okhotsk ocean, was squeezed between the two major continents. Inasmuch as the third element (the island arc) was involved in the collision it is reasonable to distinguish two branches of the Mongolia–Okhotsk suture. These branches control the spatial distribution of gold mineralization in the Trans-Baikal region. On the southeastern periphery of Siberia the crust thickened considerably after the collision and a plateau-like uplift formed. In the Early Cretaceous, when compression ceased, the collisional uplift collapsed and the thrusts were transformed into low-angle normal faults, the motions on which were responsible for the formation of rift basins and exhumation of metamorphic core complexes.},

@article{kirby07,
abstract = {Whether strike-slip fault systems in Eurasia accomplish eastward extrusion of Tibetan crust and lithosphere depends largely on the kinematics of deformation at the fault tip. Here we present new slip rate determinations using millennial-scale geomorphic markers from sites along the easternmost segment of the Kunlun fault in north central Tibet. This fault system represents one of the major strike-slip faults within the Indo-Asian collision zone, has been argued to exhibit uniform slip rates along much of its length, and plays a central role in models for eastward extrusion of Tibetan lithosphere. Displaced fluvial terrace risers along tributaries of the Yellow River, coupled with 14C ages of terrace material, provide constraints on slip rates over late Pleistocene to Holocene time. Results indicate that slip rates decrease systematically along the eastern ∼150 km of the fault from >10 to <2 mm/yr. These data challenge the view that slip along the Kunlun fault remains uniform along the entire length of the fault and instead reveal gradients in displacement similar to those expected at fault tips. Moreover, slip along the fault appears to terminate within the thickened crust of the plateau, and therefore any extrusion of Tibetan lithosphere accomplished by slip along the Kunlun fault must be absorbed by internal deformation of the plateau surrounding the fault tip.},

@article{Yokota2011,
abstract = {This paper reports large-scale direct numerical simulations of homogeneous-isotropic fluid turbulence, achieving sustained performance of 1.08 petaflop/s on gpu hardware using single precision. The simulations use a vortex particle method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, with a highly parallel fast multipole method (FMM) as numerical engine, and match the current record in mesh size for this application, a cube of 4096\^{}3 computational points solved with a spectral method. The standard numerical approach used in this field is the pseudo-spectral method, relying on the FFT algorithm as numerical engine. The particle-based simulations presented in this paper quantitatively match the kinetic energy spectrum obtained with a pseudo-spectral method, using a trusted code. In terms of parallel performance, weak scaling results show the fmm-based vortex method achieving 74\% parallel efficiency on 4096 processes (one gpu per mpi process, 3 gpus per node of the TSUBAME-2.0 system). The FFT-based spectral method is able to achieve just 14\% parallel efficiency on the same number of mpi processes (using only cpu cores), due to the all-to-all communication pattern of the FFT algorithm. The calculation time for one time step was 108 seconds for the vortex method and 154 seconds for the spectral method, under these conditions. Computing with 69 billion particles, this work exceeds by an order of magnitude the largest vortex method calculations to date.},

The rate of earthquakes varies from the background rate by a factor of 3 with the tidal stress. The highest correlation is found when we assume a coefficient of friction of mu = 0.4 for the crust, although we see good correlation for mu between 0.2 and 0.6. Our results quantify the effect of applied stress on earthquake triggering, a key factor in understanding earthquake nucleation and cascades whereby one earthquake triggers others.},

@article{Halko2009,
abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets.   This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed---either explicitly or implicitly---to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis.},

@article{Cao2012,
abstract = {The kernel-independent fast multipole method (KIFMM) proposed in [1] is of almost linear complexity. In the original KIFMM the time-consuming M2L translations are accelerated by FFT. However, when more equivalent points are used to achieve higher accuracy, the efficiency of the FFT approach tends to be lower because more auxiliary volume grid points have to be added. In this paper, all the translations of the KIFMM are accelerated by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) based on the low-rank property of the translating matrices. The acceleration of M2L is realized by first transforming the associated translating matrices into more compact form, and then using low-rank approximations. By using the transform matrices for M2L, the orders of the translating matrices in upward and downward passes are also reduced. The improved KIFMM is then applied to accelerate BEM. The performance of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by three examples. Numerical results show that, compared with the original KIFMM, the present method can reduce about 40\% of the iterating time and 25\% of the memory requirement.},

@article{Kelemen2007a,
abstract = {Intermediate-depth earthquakes, at depths of 50-300 km in subduction zones, occur below the brittle-ductile transition, where high pressures render frictional failure unlikely. Their location approximately coincides with 600 to 800 degrees C isotherms in thermal models, suggesting a thermally activated mechanism for their origin. Some earthquakes may occur by frictional failure owing to high pore pressure that might result from metamorphic dehydration. Because some intermediate-depth earthquakes occur approximately 30 to 50 km below the palaeo-sea floor, however, the hydrous minerals required for the dehydration mechanism may not be present. Here we present an alternative mechanism to explain such earthquakes, involving the onset of highly localized viscous creep in pre-existing, fine-grained shear zones. Our numerical model uses olivine flow laws for a fine-grained, viscous shear zone in a coarse-grained, elastic half space, with initial temperatures from 600-800 degrees C and background strain rates of 10(-12) to 10(-15) s(-1). When shear heating becomes important, strain rate and temperature increase rapidly to over 1 s(-1) and 1,400 degrees C. The stress then drops dramatically, followed by low strain rates and cooling. Continued far-field deformation produces a quasi-periodic series of such instabilities.},

@article{Sykes1989,
abstract = {Seismic magnitudes determined from surface and body waves for the Soviet underground nuclear explosion of September 14, 1988, are used to calculate the yield of that event from previously derived calibration curves. The yield obtained by combining the two seismic estimates is 113 kilotons, which is very close to those obtained by hydrodynamic measurements made on-site. This comparison substantiates previous conclusions about the sizes of past Soviet weapons tests and compliance with the Threshold Test Ban Treaty. The factor of uncertainty in the combined seismic yield is 1.28 at the 68\% and 1.62 at the 95\% confidence levels, demonstrating that accuracies considerably better than a factor of 2 can be obtained by combining seismic determinations of yield.},

@article{Hubbard2009,
abstract = {The Longmen Shan mountain range, site of the devastating 12 May 2008 Wenchuan (M = 7.9) earthquake, defines the eastern margin of the Himalayan orogen and exhibits greater topographic relief than anywhere else in the Tibetan plateau. However, before the earthquake, geodetic and geologic surveys measured little shortening across the range front, inspiring a vigorous debate about the process by which the topography of the mountain belt is produced and maintained. Two endmember models have been proposed: (1) brittle crustal thickening, in which thrust faults with large amounts of slip that are rooted in the lithosphere cause uplift, and (2) crustal flow, in which low-viscosity material in the lower crust extrudes outward from the Tibetan plateau and inflates the crust north and east of the Himalayas. Here we use balanced geologic cross-sections to show that crustal shortening, structural relief, and topography are strongly correlated in the range front. This suggests that crustal shortening is a primary driver for uplift and topography of the Longmen Shan on the flanks of the plateau. The 2008 Wenchuan (M = 7.9) earthquake, which ruptured a large thrust fault along the range front causing tens of thousands of fatalities and widespread damage, is an active manifestation of this shortening process.},

@article{Brown2012,
abstract = {Laboratory studies of frictional properties of rocks at slip velocities approaching the seismic range (∼0.1-1 m s(-1)), and at moderate normal stresses (1-10 MPa), have revealed a complex evolution of the dynamic shear strength, with at least two phases of weakening separated by strengthening at the onset of wholesale melting. The second post-melting weakening phase is governed by viscous properties of the melt layer and is reasonably well understood. The initial phase of extreme weakening, however, remains a subject of much debate. Here we show that the initial weakening of gabbro is associated with the formation of hotspots and macroscopic streaks of melt ('melt welts'), which partially unload the rest of the slip interface. Melt welts begin to form when the average rate of frictional heating exceeds 0.1-0.4 MW m(-2), while the average temperature of the shear zone is well below the solidus (250-450 °C). Similar heterogeneities in stress and temperature are likely to occur on natural fault surfaces during rapid slip, and to be important for earthquake rupture dynamics.},

These differences are discussed and the implications and difficulties are pointed out. Numerical simulations that illustrate the theoretical discussion are presented together with an application that show that the methodology can be used for practical problems.},

@article{Schellart2010,
abstract = {Subduction of oceanic lithosphere occurs through two modes: subducting plate motion and trench migration. Using a global subduction zone data set and three-dimensional numerical subduction models, we show that slab width (W) controls these modes and the partitioning of subduction between them. Subducting plate velocity scales with W(2/3), whereas trench velocity scales with 1/W. These findings explain the Cenozoic slowdown of the Farallon plate and the decrease in subduction partitioning by its decreasing slab width. The change from Sevier-Laramide orogenesis to Basin and Range extension in North America is also explained by slab width; shortening occurred during wide-slab subduction and overriding-plate-driven trench retreat, whereas extension occurred during intermediate to narrow-slab subduction and slab-driven trench retreat.},

abstract = {Seismic velocity changes and nonvolcanic tremor activity in the Parkfield area in California reveal that large earthquakes induce long-term perturbations of crustal properties in the San Andreas fault zone. The 2003 San Simeon and 2004 Parkfield earthquakes both reduced seismic velocities that were measured from correlations of the ambient seismic noise and induced an increased nonvolcanic tremor activity along the San Andreas fault. After the Parkfield earthquake, velocity reduction and nonvolcanic tremor activity remained elevated for more than 3 years and decayed over time, similarly to afterslip derived from GPS (Global Positioning System) measurements. These observations suggest that the seismic velocity changes are related to co-seismic damage in the shallow layers and to deep co-seismic stress change and postseismic stress relaxation within the San Andreas fault zone.},

@article{Thomas2009,
abstract = {Since its initial discovery nearly a decade ago, non-volcanic tremor has provided information about a region of the Earth that was previously thought incapable of generating seismic radiation. A thorough explanation of the geologic process responsible for tremor generation has, however, yet to be determined. Owing to their location at the plate interface, temporal correlation with geodetically measured slow-slip events and dominant shear wave energy, tremor observations in southwest Japan have been interpreted as a superposition of many low-frequency earthquakes that represent slip on a fault surface. Fluids may also be fundamental to the failure process in subduction zone environments, as teleseismic and tidal modulation of tremor in Cascadia and Japan and high Poisson ratios in both source regions are indicative of pressurized pore fluids. Here we identify a robust correlation between extremely small, tidally induced shear stress parallel to the San Andreas fault and non-volcanic tremor activity near Parkfield, California. We suggest that this tremor represents shear failure on a critically stressed fault in the presence of near-lithostatic pore pressure. There are a number of similarities between tremor in subduction zone environments, such as Cascadia and Japan, and tremor on the deep San Andreas transform, suggesting that the results presented here may also be applicable in other tectonic settings.},
