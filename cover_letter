Dear editors of Geophysical Research Letters,

Please find attached a manuscript entitled ``Rapid slip deficit rates at the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau prior to the 2008 $M_\textrm{w}$ 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake'' by T. Ben Thompson, Andreas Plesch, John H. Shaw and Brendan J. Meade. We are submitting this manuscript for consideration as an article in Geophysical Research Letters. The manuscript contains 3249 words and 4 figures.

The 2008 $M_\textrm{w}$ 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake led to the loss of more than 60,000 lives and prompted a fundamental reconsideration of how we understand the active tectonics of the remarkably steep Longmen Shan rangefront at the eastern margin of the Tibet Plateau. In particular, this seismic event has brought into sharp relief the debate over the understanding of the rangefront as a active fold-and-thrust belt or as the passive response to the deeper flow of lower crustal material.

Geodetic slip-deficit rates are a primary way of quantifying fault system activity and constraining earthquake recurrence intervals. Previous estimates of slip rates at the Longmen Shan have served as a lower bound due to the neglect interseismic earthquake cycle effects and simplified fault geometry. Recent observations of co- and post-seismic slip have identified activity on a deep shallowing dipping detachment linking the Longmen Shan range front to the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Using a new boundary element model including the effects of both topography and non-planar fault system geometry, we show how this interseismic locking on this deep fault can produce a geodetic velocity gradient that is largest 100-200 km to the northwest of the Longmen Shan rangefront, exactly as geodetically observed, yet produces a neglible velocity gradient at the steep rangefront. Constraints from observed GPS velocities measured prior to the Wenchuan earthquake, indicate that slip-deficit rates on the Longmen Shan rangefront faults may be as high as 10 mm/yr.

These results are of wide intellectual significance for three reasons: 1) Providing a new interpretation of tectonics and earthquake cycle behavior at the highly debated Longmen Shan rangefront, 2) Demonstrating how topography can be explicitly incorporated into earthquake cycle models, and most importantly 3) Illustrating the complex role that deep detachment faults can play in controlling earthquake cycle behaviors. We are optimistic that these results will contribute significantly to the debate about the tectonics of the Tibetan Plateau and, more generally, about the nature of the development of fold-and-thrust belts. 

Thanks for your thoughtful consideration of this paper. We're looking forward to hearing from you soon!
